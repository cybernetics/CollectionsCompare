# CollectionsCompare

[![][travis img]][travis]

Collections are a staple in any programming language: the need to collect, sort or iterate over values is needed by nearly all developers. The Java language introduced the Collections framework long ago and that's what many (incredibly not all!) developers learn when they start programming. It has plenty to offer, but many find it lacking: the amount of collection libraries as active open source projects demonstrate the need for something else. If we were to search to find a holistic comparison of famous collection libraries, there is not much literature available. The talk is poised to fill this gap. In this session, we will explore the most common collections (pun intended!) frameworks, what they have to offer and what you should consider for your next project. We will also show common programmer use cases, how each library handles them and the impact on memory, processing power and ease of use/coding. After this session, you will be able to choose the right bag for you tricks!
